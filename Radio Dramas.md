# Program Details

## Literary and Broadway

### [Orson Welles' Mercury Theater on the Air](https://archive.org/details/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings)

*The Mercury Theatre on the Air*, under the direction of Orson Welles, is a radio anthology series that aired from July to December 1938. Known for its adaptations of classic literary works and original scripts, the series showcased the theatrical and storytelling skills of Welles and the Mercury Theatre team. The Halloween broadcast on October 30, 1938, featuring H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds," became particularly famous for causing panic among some listeners who believed the Martian invasion depicted was real. The series also presented adaptations of literary classics such as "Dracula," "Treasure Island," and "A Tale of Two Cities."

Hopalong Cassidy is a fictional cowboy-hero, created in 1904 by Clarence E. Mulford and appearing in a series of popular stories and later novels. Here the character appears as a rude, rough-talking 'galoot'. Beginning in 1935, the character, played by William Boyd was transformed into the clean-cut hero of a series of 66 immensely popular films, only a few of which were based on Mulford's works, but which led, in turn, to a comic book series modelled after the films.

On June 24, 1949, Hoppy became the first network Western television series, airing on NBC. At first NBC fashioned the shows out of the films after paying Boyd, who owned the TV rights to his films, a quarter-million dollars for them. The footage later shot for the TV series starred Boyd, with Edgar Buchanan as his sidekick "Red Connors" and numerous tie-ins. The theme music for the TV show was written by veteran songwriters Nacio Herb Brown (music) and L. Wolfe Gilbert (lyrics). The show ranked number 7 in the 1949 Nielsen ratings. The Mutual Broadcasting System began broadcasting a radio version of Hopalong Cassidy in January 1950; at the end of September, the show moved to CBS Radio, where it ran into 1952.

Soon the audience was banished, and George went from stumbling comedic hero to tough guy private eye and the music from wah-wah-wah to suspenseful. Valentine's secretary was Claire Brooks, aka Brooksie (Frances Robinson, Virginia Gregg, Lillian Buyeff). As Valentine made his rounds in search of the bad guys, he usually encountered Brooksie's kid brother, Sonny (Eddie Firestone), Lieutenant Riley (Wally Maher) and elevator man Caleb (Joseph Kearns).

### [CBS Radio Mystery Theater](https://archive.org/details/cbsrmt-74-02-08-33-conspiracy-to-defraud)

***CBS Radio Mystery Theater*** (a.k.a. ***Radio Mystery Theater*** and ***Mystery Theater***, sometimes abbreviated as ***CBSRMT***) is a radio drama series created by Himan Brown that was broadcast on CBS Radio Network affiliates from 1974 to 1982, and later in the early 2000s was repeated by the NPR satellite feed.

The format was similar to that of classic old time radio shows like *The Mysterious Traveler* and *The Whistler*, in that the episodes were introduced by host E. G. Marshall who provided pithy wisdom and commentary throughout. Unlike the hosts of those earlier programs, Marshall is fully mortal, merely someone whose heightened insight and erudition plunge the listener into the world of the macabre.

As with Himan Brown's prior *Inner Sanctum Mysteries*, each episode of *CBS Radio Mystery Theater* opened and closed with the ominous sound of a creaking door. This sound effect is accompanied by Marshall's greeting, "Come in!… Welcome. I'm E. G. Marshall." At each show's conclusion, the door swings shut, and Marshall signs off with: "Until next time, pleasant… dreams?" This is followed by an extended variation of the show's theme music.

*CBSRMT* was broadcast each weeknight, at first with a new program each night. Later in the run, three or four episodes were new originals each week, and the remainder repeats. There were 1,399 original episodes. The total number of broadcasts, including repeats, was 2,969. Each episode was allotted a full hour of airtime, but after commercials and newscasts, each episode typically ran for around 45 minutes.

Levinson who often accepted Diamond's help reluctantly. Levinson would claim to get stomach trouble whenever Diamond would call him and would take bicarbonate to settle his aching stomach. Although they always seem at odds with each other, Diamond and Levinson were best friends.
